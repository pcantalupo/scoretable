\title{Boxplot of top scores by predicted label}
\usage{
plot_scores_by_pred(annotated_scores)
}
\arguments{
\item{annotated_scores}{A data.frame that contains columns "obs_id", "labels", and "score"
followed by one or more score columns (one for each candidate label). This is
typically the output from \code{add_labels_based_on_max()}.}
}
\value{
ggplot object that can be further customized with ggplot2 functions
}
\description{
Shows the distribution of scores for each predicted label. If you have 3 labels
there will be three boxplots drawn in the same plot. Each point is the score of
the observations of a label.
}
\examples{
set.seed(15)
m = matrix(rnorm(60), nrow = 20)
colnames(m) = c("TypeA","TypeB","TypeC")
rownames(m) = paste0("c", rep(1:nrow(m)))
pred = add_labels_based_on_max(m)

# Basic plot
plot_scores_by_pred(pred)

# Customize with ggplot2 functions
library(ggplot2)
p = plot_scores_by_pred(pred)

# Add jitter to see individual points
p + geom_jitter(width = 0.15, alpha = 0.5)

# Customize theme and colors
p + theme_minimal() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
