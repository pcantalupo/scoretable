\title{Ridge plot of top scores by predicted label}
\usage{
plot_scores_by_pred_ggridges(annotated_scores, alpha = 0.7, scale = 0.9)
}
\arguments{
\item{annotated_scores}{A data.frame that contains columns "obs_id", "labels", and
"score" followed by one or more score columns (one for each candidate label).
This is typically the output from \code{add_labels_based_on_max()}.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric value for ridge transparency (0 = transparent, 1 = opaque).
Default is 0.7.}

\item{scale}{Numeric value controlling ridge height and overlap. A value of 1
means ridges just touch (maximum point touches baseline above). Values < 1
create gaps, values > 1 create overlap. Default is 0.9.}
}
\value{
ggplot object
}
\description{
Shows the distribution of scores for each predicted label using ridge plots.
Creates density ridges for each unique predicted label, where each ridge
represents the distribution of top scores for observations with that label.

set.seed(15)
m = matrix(rnorm(60), nrow = 20)

rownames(m) = paste0("c", rep(1:nrow(m)))
