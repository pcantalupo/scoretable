\title{Expand Group Labels to Observation Level}
\usage{
expand_group_labels(annotated_scores, groups)
}
\arguments{
\item{annotated_scores}{data.frame containing at least two columns
'obs_id' and 'labels' (rows represent groups) followed optionally by score columns}

\item{groups}{A vector that specifies the group membership for each observation. Must be same length as the number of rows in \code{annotated_scores}.}
}
\value{
A vector of the same length as \code{groups} containing the expanded labels.
}
\description{
Purpose: You have an annotated scores table at the group level. However, you have a
table of metadata at the observation level with a column specifying the group. You
want to add a column of labels to your observation-level metadata. Therefore this
function will expand the group-level labels to a vector that you can add directly
to your observation-level metadata table.
}
\examples{
# Create group-level annotations
annotated_scores = data.frame(
  obs_id = 0:3,
  labels = c("Type A", "Type B", "Type C", "Type D")
)

# Observation-level group assignments
groups = c(0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1, 3)

# Map labels to observations
obs_labels = expand_group_labels(annotated_scores, groups)
print(obs_labels)
}
