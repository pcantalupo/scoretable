Description: Provides functions for annotating row observations in a matrix based on
 their highest scoring column and for exploring score distributions across
 predicted labels. Originally designed for biological applications including
 cell type annotation, the package is fully general and applicable to any
 domain where each row represents an observation (a customer, loan applicant, 
 survey respondent, etc.) and each column contains prediction scores for 
 different categories or outcomes.
